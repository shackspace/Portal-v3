Portal v3
=========

Portal v3 is the new version of the shackspace [portal](https://github.com/shackspace/portal). It controls access to the shackspace through the ssh keys of the key members. **Portal v3 is currently still in development.**

User documentation for shackspace members can be found [here](http://shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:white_box) as well as documentation of the older Portal versions.

Documentation for folks wishing to reproduce our process is in `doc/setup.md`. Developer documentation can be found in `doc/structure.md`.
